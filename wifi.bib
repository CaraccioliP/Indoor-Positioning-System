abstract = {Since GPS positioning is not reliable indoors due to problems with signal propagation, alternative solutions have to be used for navigation and monitoring of pedestrians as well as vehicles. The ubiquitous availability of Wi-Fi and its applicability in indoor positioning attract a lot of attention. The Wi-Fi Fingerprinting method is the most common method to estimate the localization of mobile users since its performance does not seem to be affected by multipath propagation. To compensate for the impact of the human body on signal propagation as well as irregularities in antenna gain the Orientated Fingerprinting Database was created. A built-in compass in mobile devices was used for the determination of the orientation of the user and was used as an additional parameter in the localization process. The proposed solution was tested in real-world conditions and compared with the accuracy of the system without orientation measurements. The RMSE with a compass was 4.04 m and without a compass was between 4.21 m up to 5.73 m. From the achieved results it seems that orientation information can help to improve the performance of the localization system, however, it will increase the complexity of the system deployment significantly.}
