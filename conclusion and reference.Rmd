# Conclusion

The decrease in the distribution of signal strength indicates a linear decline concerning logarithmic distance. Employing a simple triangulation method allows us to determine the precise location of the device. We investigated the distribution of signal strength across various orientations and access points, observing fluctuations in signal strength for both nearby and distant points. In the field of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS), predictive capabilities have valuable applications across a range of industries. Stakeholders can identify impediments in movement, whether it involves a crowd at an airport, packages navigating a warehouse, or optimizing foot traffic in high-profit areas of retail establishments. Companies such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL, responsible for transporting delicate biological samples, could gain advantages from the increased utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices for real-time tracking. In warehouses bustling with human activity and machinery, the risk of misplacing packages persists, even with strict regulations. IPS and IoT offer a thorough record of the entire journey for sensitive packages, ensuring accountability for patients, medical facilities, shippers, and regulatory bodies.
